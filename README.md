see [Advent of Code, Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1)

Late night coding for fun. Old fashioned Windows console application, written in C#. No error checking or embellishments.

To use, supply the input as the first argument on the command line, eg.:
```
AdventOfCode01.exe 12131415
```

...or as such in the Visual Studio Project (```Debug → Start Options → Command Line Arguments```)
